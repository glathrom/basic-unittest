# Hello World Project

## Install for Development

In order to run the tests it is easiest to install the module but in development mode so that we edit and not have to reinstall.
See [here](https://godatadriven.com/blog/a-practical-guide-to-using-setup-py/) for more details.
Run the following command in the package directory.

```
   > pip install -e .
```
